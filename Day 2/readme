# Rollercoaster Height Check

This repository contains a simple Python script to determine if a person is tall enough to ride a rollercoaster. The script prompts the user to enter their height in centimeters and then checks if the height meets the minimum requirement to ride the rollercoaster.

## Features

- Checks if the entered height is greater than the minimum required height.
- Provides appropriate messages based on the height entered.
- Handles invalid input gracefully.
